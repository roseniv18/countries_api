# Challenge by [Frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca/hub/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-H1rGLq3M5)

I built this using:

-   React
-   React Context API
-   CSS
-   React Unicons
-   For the API I used [restcountries](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3-all)

## The challenge:

Your challenge is integrating with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end, such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

-   See all countries from the API on the homepage
-   Search for a country using an input field
-   Filter countries by region
-   Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
-   Click through to the border countries on the detail page
-   Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)
